//////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Based on the modules you have built (Dashboard, Lidar Scan, 3D Visualizer, and Legal Chatbot), here is a logical breakdown of tasks for the Lawyer and House Developer.

These tasks use the same system features but for different goals.

2. Lawyer (The Legal Validator)
Goal: To verify if the defect claims are legally valid under the Housing Development Act (HDA) and manage disputes.

Review "Evidence Packages":

Access the My Projects view to see their clients' cases.




Open the Processing Report to verify if the Lidar scan and photos provide enough proof for a legal claim.



Validate Defect Severity:

Check the AI Confidence & Severity scores (e.g., "High Severity") to decide if a defect is worth pursuing a tribunal claim.



HDA Clause Lookup:

Use the Legal Chatbot to quickly pull up specific clauses regarding disputes or "Vacant Possession" dates to draft legal letters.




Monitor Tribunal Deadlines:

Track the dates in the system (e.g., "Scan Date: 2025-12-14") to ensure claims are filed within the 24-month DLP window.




3. House Developer (The Fixer)
Goal: To receive claims, verify them remotely (to save costs), and manage the repair teams.

Manage Incoming Claims:

View a Master Dashboard of all units (e.g., "ASMARINDA12", "Unit A-85") to see new defect submissions in real-time.





Remote Inspection (Virtual Verification):

Use the 3D Visualizer to look at the "Wall Crack #1" on the 3D model. This allows them to approve the defect without sending a worker to the site first.




Update Repair Status:

Change the status of a project from "Processing" to "In Progress" or "Repaired" so the homeowner sees the update on their dashboard.


Review Defect Heatmaps:

Look at the list of defects to see if there is a pattern (e.g., "Why do 10 units have leaking roofs?") to fix systemic construction issues.
